# SANS-Fall-Games-NCL-CTF

I didn’t actually become interested in cybersecurity until years after I was already working in the field. At first, it was just a job—but as I started getting better at incident response, tuning detections, and solving complex problems, I realized how much I genuinely enjoyed the work. The more my skills grew, the more invested I became, and that’s when cybersecurity shifted from something I did to something I cared about.

Reflection on My CTF Experience
Participating in this CTF pushed me to think more creatively and work under pressure while analyzing unfamiliar data and formats. I learned how small details can lead to major breakthroughs and how important it is to stay methodical even when stuck. Overall, the experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and boosted my confidence in handling real-world security scenarios.

CTF Highlights
One of the biggest highlights was cracking several passwords by building a custom Python-based wordlist generator that created massive dictionaries in manageable chunks. The script iteratively produced each chunk, passed it directly into Hashcat for processing, and then automatically deleted the file to conserve disk space. It was a practical, resource-efficient solution that let me brute-force complex passwords without overwhelming my system. Pulling this off—and seeing the workflow actually crack real hashes—was easily one of the most rewarding parts of the CTF.
